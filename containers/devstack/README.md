# XOS DevStack Docker image

This directory containers the configuration to build a docker image for an
instance of [OpenStack's
DevStack](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/overview.html) to support
a development / experimental XOS environment. This docker image is based on the
[quick start installation
instructions](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/) documented by
OpenStack.
